# Installing Jupyter Extension for Visual Studio Code - Prerequisites
- Make sure you have Visual Studio Code (VSCode) installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Steps to Install Jupyter Extension
1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
3. Search for "Jupyter" in the Extensions view search box.
4. Look for the "Jupyter" extension provided by Microsoft. It should be the one with the Jupyter logo.
5. Click the "Install" button next to the "Jupyter" extension.
6. Once the installation is complete, you may need to reload VSCode to activate the extension. You can do this by clicking the "Reload" button that appears after the extension is installed.

## Running Jupyter Notebooks
1. Open or create a Jupyter Notebook file with the name `1191103225.ipynb`.
2. Select the Jupyter environment: At the top right of the Notebook editor, you will see a dropdown menu for selecting the Jupyter kernel (Python version). Choose the desired Python kernel for your notebook.
3. Use the VSCode UI or keyboard shortcuts to run cells, create new cells, and interact with your Jupyter Notebook.
