The simple method relies on colour information, where objects or regions can be segmented by clustering pixel values, a step higher than just thresholding. More powerful graph-based algorithms such as Felzenswalb's method and SLIC superpixels can also be used to segment regions using a variety of affinities between pixels such as brightness, color, textures, etc. In addition, to extend our current understanding of feature representations, we can now attempt to extract features from these segments (instead of individual pixels) to construct feature histograms, which can be used for matching images.\n","\n","In addition to the typical libraries, we will use several libraries from [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/) package to enable us to perform segmentation with minimal coding overhead.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#install ipympl for interactive figure in Google Colab\n","!pip install ipympl"],"metadata":{"id":"n0C0tsadR8TV"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"id":"va6A3enKOpnI"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Subjects/TDS3651/2210/Labs/Lab07/'"],"metadata":{"id":"LqQx6hzcOrfD"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import cv2\n","import numpy as np\n","from matplotlib import pyplot as plt"],"metadata":{"id":"dXGw5FyvOvl7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Recap: Segmentation by color\n","In the previous color processing lab, the HSV color space were used with a range thresholding to perform segmentation.
